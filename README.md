# holman/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

I do a lot of talks and posts about
[How GitHub Works](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works/) because I love
talking and discussing how software gets built. So If you have any questions
about GitHub, our culture, work practices, technical aspects, or questions about
me in general, send 'em this way... I'd be happy to shed some light on the
issue.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're still better off
if you [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll
end up getting a much faster response back that way.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
