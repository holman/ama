# holman/ama

A repository to ask [@holman](https://twitter.com/holman) anything.

I [worked at GitHub](http://zachholman.com/about) for five years and have [written](http://zachholman.com) and [spoken](http://zachholman.com/talks) a lot about building company culture, improving your development workflow, and really important shit like emoji. If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the joint for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/holman/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/holman/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@holman](https://twitter.com/holman) on
Twitter.
